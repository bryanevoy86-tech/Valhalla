# VALHALLA GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

**Complete operational framework for system scale, engine discipline, and strategic decision-making.**

---

## Directory Overview

```
/governance/           ← Core doctrine and policy
/engines/              ← Engine lifecycle and registry
  /templates/          ← Certification templates
  /side_hustles/       ← Fast-track side hustle testing
/advisory/             ← Strategic decision frameworks
/legal/                ← Trust and residency planning
```

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE LAYER

**Where the rules live. This is locked.**

### [doctrine.md](governance/doctrine.md)
The founding principles of the system. Non-negotiable.

- Infinite scale, finite risk
- System-first priority
- Sandbox-first for all engines
- Reversibility for all irreversible actions

**Read this first. Everything else flows from here.**

### [extraction_policy.md](governance/extraction_policy.md)
Capital allocation locked for 5-year compounding window.

- Minimum extraction: 10% (never reduced)
- Duration: 5+ years (no increases during window)
- Post-compounding review optional, reversible

**This is frozen. No modifications until Phase 4+ review.**

### [heimdall_role.md](governance/heimdall_role.md)
Operator + Heimdall relationship model.

- Heimdall: Challenge authority (can advise against)
- Operator: Final authority (always decides)
- Neither blocks the other

**Heimdall succeeds when operator makes better-informed decisions.**

---

## 2. ENGINE LIFECYCLE

**How engines move from idea to production.**

### [ENGINE_REGISTRY.md](engines/ENGINE_REGISTRY.md)
Complete inventory of all engines.

- Status of each engine (candidate, testing, active)
- Lifecycle stages
- Current: Valhalla Core (Phase 3 certified)
- Candidates: Storage cleanouts, landscaping, arbitrage

**This is the source of truth for what's running and what's pending.**

### Engine Certification Templates

All new engines follow this path:

**STAGE 0: [ENGINE_INTAKE.md](engines/templates/ENGINE_INTAKE.md)**
- Capture the idea
- Document assumptions
- Go/no-go checklist

**STAGE 1: [ENGINE_SOLO_SANDBOX_CERT.md](engines/templates/ENGINE_SOLO_SANDBOX_CERT.md)**
- Test in isolation (DRY_RUN=1)
- Prove stability
- Document results

**STAGE 2: [ENGINE_INTEGRATED_SANDBOX_CERT.md](engines/templates/ENGINE_INTEGRATED_SANDBOX_CERT.md)**
- Test alongside other engines
- Prove it doesn't break anything
- Establish resource throttles if needed

**STAGE 3: [ENGINE_READY_CERT.md](engines/templates/ENGINE_READY_CERT.md)**
- Approval gate
- Dormant but safe
- Phase 4 activation ready

### Side Hustle Fast Track

**[SIDE_HUSTLE_FAST_SANDBOX.md](engines/side_hustles/SIDE_HUSTLE_FAST_SANDBOX.md)**

Quick signal detection for low-risk ideas:
- 1-3 hour test
- 4 simple questions
- PROMOTE / PARK / ARCHIVE decision

**Use this for side hustles. Use full pipeline for core engines.**

---

## 3. ADVISORY LAYER

**Strategic decision frameworks. Informational, not prescriptive.**

### [BUSINESS_GPS.md](advisory/BUSINESS_GPS.md)
Route-planning framework.

```
Operator: "I want to reach X"
Heimdall: "Here are all routes to X"
Operator: Chooses route
Heimdall: Executes chosen route
```

Every route includes:
- Steps
- Timeline
- Risks
- Trade-offs
- Reversibility

### [CHALLENGE_REPORT.md](advisory/CHALLENGE_REPORT.md)
When Heimdall recommends against a proposed action.

- What's the concern?
- What are alternatives?
- What happens if you proceed anyway?
- Operator override documented

**Challenges surface risks, not block progress.**

### [DECISION_LOG.md](advisory/DECISION_LOG.md)
Complete record of all major operator decisions.

- What was decided
- Why (operator's reasoning)
- Heimdall's advice
- Outcome (filled in later)

**System memory. Review periodically to identify patterns.**

---

## 4. LEGAL PLANNING

**Strategic overview of trust and residency. Advisory only.**

### [TRUST_RESIDENCY_OVERVIEW.md](legal/TRUST_RESIDENCY_OVERVIEW.md)
When trust and residency matter, and when they don't.

- Current state
- Possible future scenarios
- When to act vs. when to wait
- Professional resources needed

**Do not execute without licensed professionals. This is planning, not legal advice.**

---

## How These Pieces Connect

### For Running the System
1. **doctrine.md** ← Core rules
2. **extraction_policy.md** ← Capital allocation
3. **ENGINE_REGISTRY.md** ← What's live

### For Adding New Engines
1. **ENGINE_INTAKE.md** ← Capture idea
2. **ENGINE_SOLO_SANDBOX_CERT.md** ← Test in isolation
3. **ENGINE_INTEGRATED_SANDBOX_CERT.md** ← Test in system
4. **ENGINE_READY_CERT.md** ← Approval gate

Or fast-track with **SIDE_HUSTLE_FAST_SANDBOX.md** for low-risk ideas.

### For Making Decisions
1. **BUSINESS_GPS.md** ← Map routes
2. **CHALLENGE_REPORT.md** ← Surface risks (if applicable)
3. **DECISION_LOG.md** ← Record decision + outcome

### For Long-Term Planning
1. **TRUST_RESIDENCY_OVERVIEW.md** ← Strategic options
2. **DECISION_LOG.md** ← Track decisions over time
3. Review quarterly/annually

## Key Principles

✅ **Ideas don't earn permanence. Proof does.**  
✅ **Sandbox-first for everything.**  
✅ **Operator + Heimdall model: Advisor + Authority.**  
✅ **All decisions documented and reversible.**  
✅ **System health > Personal comfort.**  
✅ **No single point of failure.**  

---

## Current State (Phase 3)

**Active System:**
- Valhalla Core: Phase 3 certified, 72-hour test running

**Policies Locked:**
- Doctrine: Non-negotiable
- Extraction: 10% for 5+ years
- Heimdall role: Challenge authority only

**Engines Pending:**
- Storage cleanouts: Candidate (awaiting intake)
- Landscaping: Candidate (awaiting intake)
- Arbitrage: Candidate (awaiting intake)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

1. Complete 72-hour certification ✅ (in progress)
2. Document outcomes in DECISION_LOG.md
3. Propose new engines via ENGINE_INTAKE.md
4. Test candidates via solo + integrated sandbox
5. Activate ready engines per operator choice
6. Monitor via BUSINESS_GPS and advisory layer

**Governance structure complete and operational.**  
**Everything is documented, locked where needed, and updateable where appropriate.**  
**This does not interfere with the 72-hour sandbox run.**
