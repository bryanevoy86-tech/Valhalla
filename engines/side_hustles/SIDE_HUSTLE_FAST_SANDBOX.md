# SIDE HUSTLE FAST SANDBOX

Rapid testing track for side hustle ideas.

## Purpose

Fast signal detection, not perfection.

For low-risk, quickly reversible ideas that don't need the full 6-stage pipeline.

## Eligibility Criteria

**Qualify for Fast Track if:**

- [ ] Reversible (can shut down instantly)
- [ ] Low capital requirement
- [ ] Low operational complexity
- [ ] Clear success/failure signal in <3 hours
- [ ] No legal complications
- [ ] Won't break other systems if it fails

**Do NOT use Fast Track for:**

- Complex integrations
- High-capital ideas
- Hard-to-reverse commitments
- Ideas with legal gray zones
- Systems that could cause data corruption

## Fast Track Process

```
CANDIDATE → FAST SANDBOX (1-3 hours) → PROMOTE/PARK/ARCHIVE
```

### Step 1: Quick Intake

**Idea Name:**  
**Why fast track eligible:**  
**3-hour test plan:**  

### Step 2: Run Test

**Start time:**  
**Test duration:** (actual)  
**Environment:** DRY_RUN=1, isolated, reversible  

### Step 3: Quick Assessment

Answer these 4 questions:

1. **Does it work at all?**  
   (Does the basic mechanism function? Yes/No/Partial)

2. **Is it annoying?**  
   (Is the operational overhead acceptable? Yes/No)

3. **Does it waste time?**  
   (Is the time investment worth the return? Yes/No)

4. **Does it create stress?**  
   (Will this add anxiety to daily operations? Yes/No)

### Step 4: Outcome Decision

Based on your gut feeling from the test:

- [ ] **PROMOTE** → Move to full ENGINE_INTAKE.md process
- [ ] **PARK** → Shelve for later; revisit in 3-6 months
- [ ] **ARCHIVE** → Kill this idea; don't revisit

## Decision Rules

**PROMOTE if:**
- At least 3/4 answers are YES
- You have energy/interest to scale it
- It passed its 3-hour proof-of-concept

**PARK if:**
- Answers are mixed but promising
- You need more data or time
- It's not urgent

**ARCHIVE if:**
- 2+ answers are NO
- You have no appetite for it
- Better ideas exist with same time investment

## Example Fast Track Tests

**Storage Cleanouts:**
- Test with 1-2 properties
- 3 hours total
- Measure: Time per property, actual payout, customer satisfaction

**Landscaping:**
- Test with 1 neighbor's yard
- 2 hours total
- Measure: Time, effort, payment willingness

**Arbitrage:**
- Monitor market for 30 min, try 1 transaction
- 1 hour total
- Measure: Speed to execution, profit margin, stress level

## No Failure on Fast Track

Fast track tests are **always valuable** because:

- ✅ Failure data is success data
- ✅ You learn what doesn't work
- ✅ You know whether to pursue full testing
- ✅ You lose minimal time/capital

**Fast track completes in 3 hours. Decide. Move on.**

*Make decisions fast on low-risk ideas so you can focus engineering on high-value engines.*
