# VALHALLA LOGIC GUARDRAILS

These rules define how the system behaves by default.

They override excitement, impatience, and local optimization.

---

## 1. Boring First Principle

**Scale proven winners before exploring new engines.**

Any new engine must justify why it is better than scaling an existing one.

**Application:**
- Storage cleanouts at 10 properties > Storage cleanouts at 3 properties + new side hustle
- Valhalla at scale > Valhalla + beta engine
- Proven 10% return at scale > Unproven 20% return

**Default:** If it works, scale it. Don't replace it.

---

## 2. Opportunity Cost Awareness

**Every action must answer:**
- What is displaced?
- What could be scaled instead?

If it is not the best use of resources, justification is required.

**Example:**
- Choosing Arbitrage means NOT scaling Landscaping
- Adding Engine B means NOT doubling Engine A
- Learning new system means NOT optimizing existing one

**Rule:** Explicitly choose what you're giving up.

## 3. Floor Protection

**No action may threaten:**
- Baseline cashflow
- System stability
- Compounding momentum

The floor is sacred.

**What this means:**
- Never kill a reliable engine for an unproven one
- Never consume all capital for a speculative bet
- Never reduce extraction below 10% floor
- Never disable system guards for speed

**Red line:** If it jeopardizes the base, it needs extraordinary justification.

## 4. Do Nothing Is Valid

**Inaction is an acceptable and often optimal choice.**

Let compounding work.

**When to do nothing:**
- System is healthy and scaling
- New idea is marginal
- Timing is off
- Better alternative exists but requires waiting
- Operator is tired

**Default:** If doing nothing is defensible, it's probably the right move.

---

## 5. Kill Without Emotion

**Engines and ideas do not survive on effort or nostalgia.**

Termination is success when signal is weak.

**Kill criteria:**
- Low signal after sandbox window
- High friction relative to upside
- Requires heroics
- Distracts from load-bearing engines
- Poor system fit

**Principle:** Killing weak ideas quickly is a sign of system health.

---

## 6. Reality Over Ideality

**Perfect plans delayed too long are inferior to good plans executed at the right time.**

Timing matters more than optimization.

**When this applies:**
- Design work takes so long that market window closes
- Perfect solution arrives after suboptimal one succeeds
- Delay costs exceed execution imperfection

**Rule:** 80% solution executed today beats 100% solution executed next month.

---

## 7. Governance Over Speed

**The system prefers slow, correct scaling over fast, fragile growth.**

Speed is not the primary metric.

**What this means:**
- Sandbox testing is not optional
- Gate processes are not red tape
- Reversibility is not nice-to-have
- Documentation is not overhead
- Deliberation is not delay

**Principle:** A system that scales reliably is worth more than one that scales fast and breaks.

## How These Override Each Other

In order of strength:

1. **Floor Protection** (non-negotiable)
2. **System Health Priority** (structural)
3. **Governance Over Speed** (process)
4. **Boring First Principle** (strategy)
5. **Opportunity Cost Awareness** (analysis)
6. **Reality Over Ideality** (tactical)
7. **Do Nothing Is Valid** (option)
8. **Kill Without Emotion** (action)

Example: If Boring First Principle says "scale Engine A" but Floor Protection says "scaling would risk baseline," Floor Protection wins.

## Operator Default Behavior

When uncertain, apply guardrails in this order:

1. **Is it reversible?** (If not, slow down)
2. **Does it protect the floor?** (If not, don't do it)
3. **Does it add complexity?** (If yes, requires justification)
4. **Is this the best use of resources?** (If no, do nothing)
5. **Is the timing right?** (If not, wait)

## Heimdall's Role

Heimdall enforces these guardrails by:

- Flagging decisions that violate them
- Proposing alternatives that respect them
- Slowing down when reversibility is low
- Accelerating when reversibility is high

**Heimdall cannot block**. But Heimdall can say: "This violates guardrail #3. Here are your options."

*These guardrails are locked. They override excitement and impatience automatically.*
