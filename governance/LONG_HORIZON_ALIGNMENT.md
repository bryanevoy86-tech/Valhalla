# LONG HORIZON ALIGNMENT

Short-term wins must not distort long-term intent.

Valhalla is built for the long game.

## Core Principle

**Legacy > Convenience**

A decision that gives comfort today but reduces system size tomorrow is a bad decision.

---

## The Alignment Check

Before committing to significant decisions, ask:

### Does This Move Us Closer To 10-Year Goals?

**Define 10-year goals explicitly:**
- System size (revenue, capital, ops)
- Engine count and diversity
- Operator workload
- Legacy positioning
- Intergenerational readiness

**Example goals:**
- System generating $1M+ annual
- 5-7 engines running autonomously
- Operator working 10-15 hours/week
- System documented for successor
- Capital base sufficient for expansions

### Does This Reinforce Long-Term Intent?

**Example alignments:**
- Extraction policy (10% for 5+ years) → Compounding over comfort ✓
- Boring first principle → System stability over novelty ✓
- Sandbox discipline → Proof over speed ✓
- Operator protection → Sustainability over heroics ✓

**Example misalignments:**
- Forced growth → Destabilizes compounding ✗
- Ignoring extraction policy → Comfort over legacy ✗
- Skipping sandbox testing → Speed over proof ✗
- Heroic operation → Burnout over sustainability ✗

### Does This Weaken or Strengthen Durability?

**Durability metrics:**
- Can system survive if operator changes? (intergenerational)
- Is system documented for handoff? (continuity)
- Are engines truly independent? (non-heroic)
- Is capital deployed wisely? (longevity)

**Check:**
- Decision that increases durability → Likely aligned
- Decision that decreases durability → Likely misaligned

## Short-Term Deviation

**Sometimes short-term deviation is necessary.**

Example:
- 10-year goal: Operator working 10 hrs/week
- Current reality: Operator working 25 hrs/week
- Decision: Throttle growth for 6 months to reach sustainable level

**This is aligned (short-term deviation for long-term alignment).**

**But requires:**
1. Clear justification (why is short-term deviation necessary?)
2. Explicit timeline (how long will this deviation last?)
3. Recovery plan (how do we get back to aligned path?)
4. Documentation (decision log captures this)

---

## Misalignment Signals

### Red Flag 1: Comfort Drives Decisions
"I want to extract more capital because I'm tired."

**Check:** Does this align with 10-year goal?
- If goal requires 5+ years compounding → NO, misaligned
- If goal reached and extraction is fair → YES, aligned

### Red Flag 2: Impatience Overrides Discipline
"We've tested enough. Let's launch early."

**Check:** Does this align with "proof before production"?
- If timeline was overly cautious → Maybe aligned
- If signal is still unclear → NO, misaligned

### Red Flag 3: Ignoring Long-Horizon For Quick Win
"This engine isn't core but it pays well."

**Check:** Does this align with "system stability first"?
- If it doesn't threaten core → Maybe aligned
- If it diverts resources from core → NO, misaligned

### Red Flag 4: Eroding Operator Protection
"We need the operator to work 50 hours to hit this target."

**Check:** Does this align with "sustainable operation"?
- If temporary crisis → Maybe acceptable
- If permanent → NO, fundamentally misaligned

## Heimdall's Role

Heimdall flags:
- Decisions misaligned with long-term goals
- Operator drift from stated intent
- Short-term wins that harm durability
- Impatience overriding discipline

**Heimdall provides:**
1. Explicit alignment check
2. Long-term goal reminder
3. Trade-off analysis
4. Alternative paths that stay aligned

## Decision Template

For significant decisions, use this:

```
DECISION: [What are we deciding?]

LONG-TERM GOALS:
- Year 10 target: [Be specific]
- Intergenerational readiness: [Required? Why?]
- Durability requirement: [What matters?]

ALIGNMENT CHECK:
1. Does this move toward 10-year goal? [Yes/No/Partially]
2. Does this reinforce long-term intent? [Yes/No]
3. Does this strengthen durability? [Yes/No]

IF MISALIGNED:
- What is the short-term gain? [Specific benefit]
- What is the long-term cost? [Specific risk]
- Is short-term deviation justified? [Yes/No]
- How do we realign? [Path back]

HEIMDALL RECOMMENDATION:
[Aligned / Misaligned + reasoning]

OPERATOR DECISION:
[Choice + justification]

ALIGNMENT REVIEW DATE:
[When to check if we're back on track]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Extraction Policy

**Short-term temptation:** Extract 20% this year (feel wealthier)

**Long-term goal:** Build $10M+ system by year 10

**Alignment check:**
- Moving toward goal? NO (extraction reduces compounding)
- Reinforcing intent? NO (violates "system first")
- Strengthening durability? NO (less capital for pivots)

**Verdict:** Misaligned. Stick to 10% policy.

### Example 2: Operator Hours

**Short-term temptation:** Push operator to 40 hrs/week to scale faster

**Long-term goal:** Operator at 10 hrs/week, system autonomous

**Alignment check:**
- Moving toward goal? NO (going opposite direction)
- Reinforcing intent? NO (violates "sustainable operation")
- Strengthening durability? NO (depends on heroics)

**Verdict:** Misaligned. Reduce load, automate, delay growth.

### Example 3: Engine Expansion

**Decision:** Add 2 new engines (we have bandwidth)

**Long-term goal:** 5-7 engines in year 10, diverse, independent

**Alignment check:**
- Moving toward goal? YES (building toward target)
- Reinforcing intent? YES (diversification)
- Strengthening durability? YES (less dependent on one engine)

**Verdict:** Aligned. Proceed if sandbox testing passes.

## Annual Long-Horizon Review

**Once per year, assess:**

1. Are we tracking toward 10-year goals?
2. Have any goals changed? (If so, document why)
3. Have we deviated from aligned path? (If so, why and for how long?)
4. Do we need course correction?
5. Is intergenerational readiness on track?

**Update decision log with findings.**

## Principle

**Short term is for tactics. Long term is for strategy.**

Alignment keeps tactics serving strategy, not the reverse.

---

*A system built for 10 years beats a system built for quarterly results. Stay aligned.*
