# CAPITAL EXTRACTION POLICY

## Permanent Floor

- **Minimum extraction:** 10% of net capital gains
- **Never reduced** — This floor cannot go down
- **Never paused** — Must be maintained continuously

## Compounding Window

- **Extraction fixed at:** 10%
- **Duration:** Minimum 5 years (preferably 10)
- **No increases permitted** during this window
- Rationale: System needs predictable reinvestment

## Post-Compounding Review

After the minimum window:

- Extraction increases are **optional**, not automatic
- Only considered when reinvestment **no longer materially accelerates growth**
- All increases must be **reversible** (can be rolled back if system growth slows)
- Requires operator review + documented justification

## Capital Allocation

```
100% of gains = {
  10% minimum extraction (locked)
  90% reinvestment (system scaling)
}
```

During post-compounding review:

```
100% of gains = {
  10-X% extraction (variable, reversible)
  (90-X)% reinvestment (adaptive)
}
```

## Philosophy

**The goal is system dominance first, comfort later.**

A 10x bigger system with 10% extraction beats a small system with 50% extraction.

Personal wealth compounds best when the underlying system compounds first.

## Enforcement

- This policy is frozen until operator explicitly reviews and modifies it
- Changes require documented business case
- All changes must pass governance review
- Extraction cannot exceed 50% under any circumstance during current phase

---

*Policy frozen as of Phase 3. No modifications until Phase 4+ review cycle.*
