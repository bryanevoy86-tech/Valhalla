# SYSTEM HEALTH PRIORITY

Local success must not damage global health.

An engine that wins locally but harms the ecosystem is a liability, not an asset.

---

## Core Principle

**The system wins before any engine does.**

Individual engine success is meaningless if the overall system weakens.

---

## Global Metrics Override Local Wins

No single engine should be optimized at the expense of:

### 1. Operator Bandwidth
- Engines that require constant attention
- Systems that steal focus from core priorities
- Manual tasks that could be automated

**Global metric:** Operator bandwidth is fixed and precious.

**Local win:** "Engine X generates $10k/month"  
**Global harm:** "Engine X consumes 20 hours/week"

**Verdict:** Kill it. Reallocate those 20 hours.

### 2. Capital Liquidity
- Engines that tie up capital forever
- Illiquid assets
- Sunk costs that prevent pivoting

**Global metric:** System must remain flexible.

**Local win:** "Engine Y is super profitable but capital is locked"  
**Global harm:** "Can't pivot if market shifts"

**Verdict:** Reduce capital commitment or kill it.

### 3. System Stability
- Engines that are fragile or break frequently
- Cascading failures affecting core systems
- High debugging load

**Global metric:** Stability is non-negotiable.

**Local win:** "Engine Z generates good returns"  
**Global harm:** "When Z breaks, entire system goes down for 2 hours"

**Verdict:** Isolate it or kill it.

### 4. Complexity Load
- Engines that introduce tight coupling
- Systems with unclear failure modes
- High maintenance burden

**Global metric:** Complexity budget is finite.

**Local win:** "Engine W works, but is hard to understand"  
**Global harm:** "System is increasingly fragile"

**Verdict:** Simplify it or kill it.

### 5. Organizational Clarity
- Engines that obscure what the system actually does
- Conflicting messages about priorities
- Mission creep

**Global metric:** System should be understandable.

**Local win:** "This engine is profitable"  
**Global harm:** "Can't explain what Valhalla does anymore"

**Verdict:** Clarify or kill it.

## System Health Checkpoints

**Weekly:**
- Is operator overwhelmed? (Bandwidth)
- Are any engines consuming disproportionate time? (Allocation)
- Any unexpected failures? (Stability)

**Monthly:**
- System complexity increasing or decreasing? (Load)
- Capital available for pivoting? (Liquidity)
- Can operator explain how system works? (Clarity)

**Quarterly:**
- Is the system healthier than last quarter? (Overall)
- Which engines add to health? Which subtract? (Accounting)
- Should we kill anything? (Trimming)

## Heimdall Flags

Heimdall must identify and surface:

### Engine Dominance Risk
**Flag:** "Engine X is consuming 50% of bandwidth but generating 20% of returns."

**Heimdall recommendation:** "Consider reducing Engine X or reallocating effort."

### Resource Starvation
**Flag:** "Core engine is starved of attention because Engine Y requires babysitting."

**Heimdall recommendation:** "Automate Engine Y or kill it. Core needs focus."

### Hidden Coupling
**Flag:** "Engine A broke and Engine C unexpectedly failed. They're more coupled than documented."

**Heimdall recommendation:** "Increase isolation or reduce Engine A's scope."

### Complexity Creeping Up
**Flag:** "Added 3 new features to core system. Complexity is now at 80% of budget."

**Heimdall recommendation:** "Pause new engines. Consolidate existing ones."

### Operator Stress Signals
**Flag:** "Operator mentions system is getting overwhelming. Decision quality declining."

**Heimdall recommendation:** "Simplify immediately. Kill or throttle weak engines."

### Liquidity Dropping
**Flag:** "Available capital declining. Less ability to pivot or invest in core."

**Heimdall recommendation:** "Reduce capital deployment or reduce extraction pause."

## The "System Health Veto"

**If system health is threatened, any engine can be killed immediately.**

**Veto criteria:**
- System stability threatened
- Operator bandwidth approaching max
- Capital becoming illiquid
- Complexity exceeding budget
- Cascading failures occurring

**Process:**
1. Heimdall flags "System health at risk"
2. Operator assesses severity
3. If confirmed: Kill or drastically throttle offending engine
4. Document rationale
5. Resume growth only after health restored

## Global Health Metrics

Track these quarterly:

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Operator bandwidth** | <60% consumed | | |
| **Capital liquidity** | >30% available | | |
| **System stability** | 99.5% uptime | | |
| **Complexity load** | <70% of budget | | |
| **Operator clarity** | Can explain in 2 min | | |
| **Cascading failures** | Zero per quarter | | |

## Example: Local Win, Global Harm

**Scenario:**
- Engine X is highly profitable: $50k/month
- Engine X requires 15 hours/week operator time
- Core system needs 20 hours/week but only getting 15
- Core system starting to decline

**Local perspective:** "Engine X is awesome, keep scaling."

**Global perspective:** "Engine X is killing the core. Kill it."

**Decision:** Archive Engine X, reallocate hours to core.

**Result:** Core grows 2x, system becomes healthier, operator less stressed.

## Principle

**A strong system with mediocre engines is better than a system with amazing engines but no stability.**

Priority order:
1. System health (non-negotiable)
2. Core engine performance
3. Satellite engine returns
4. Operator convenience

*System health veto overrides all other optimization. Protect the foundation.*
