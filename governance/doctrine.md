# VALHALLA DOCTRINE

## Core Principles

- **Infinite scale, finite risk** — Systems scale exponentially; risk must never scale with them
- **System-first priority** — System health > any single component or extraction
- **Intergenerational continuity** — Built to outlive current operator, survive transitions
- **Non-heroic operation** — No manual intervention required for normal function
- **Governance over impulse** — Policy always wins over convenience
- **Sandbox-first for all engines** — Proof in isolation before integration
- **Reversibility for all irreversible actions** — Think twice before burning bridges

## Compounding First

The system prioritizes **long-term compounding over short-term extraction**.

Early comfort must never reduce future system size.

- Year 1-5: Maximize reinvestment
- Year 5+: Graduated extraction as appropriate
- Philosophy: Bigger engine > more personal comfort

## Engine Discipline

No engine enters production without:

1. **Solo sandbox certification** — Proof it works in isolation
2. **Integrated sandbox certification** — Proof it plays well with others
3. **Human approval** — Explicit sign-off before going live

**Ideas do not earn permanence. Proof does.**

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- DRY_RUN mode locked for all sandbox testing
- OUTBOUND_DISABLED for Phase 3 operations
- Guards enforced at entry, not as suggestions
- Extraction capped at compounding window rates
- All engines reversible until proven irreplaceable

## Governance Victory Conditions

✅ System runs unattended for 72 hours  
✅ All engines pass sandbox certification  
✅ Extraction policy frozen until review  
✅ Heimdall advisory authority established  
✅ Operator maintains final decision authority  
✅ No single point of failure exists
