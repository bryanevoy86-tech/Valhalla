PACK TH: Crisis Management Models

DEPRECATED: This module is superseded by pack_sp.py which defines CrisisProfile, 
CrisisActionStep, and CrisisLogEntry. All imports should use pack_sp.py instead.

This file is kept for backward compatibility but should not be used directly.
The table definitions in pack_sp.py are the authoritative source.
"""

# All crisis-related models have been moved to pack_sp.py to avoid duplicate table definitions
# See: app/models/pack_sp.py for CrisisProfile, CrisisActionStep, CrisisLogEntry classes
