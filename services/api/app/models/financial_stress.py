"""
PACK TI: Financial Stress Early Warning Models

DEPRECATED: This module is superseded by pack_st.py which defines FinancialIndicator, 
FinancialStressEvent, and FinancialStressSummary. All imports should use pack_st.py instead.

This file is kept for backward compatibility but should not be used directly.
The table definitions in pack_st.py are the authoritative source.
"""

# All financial-stress-related models have been moved to pack_st.py to avoid duplicate table definitions
# See: app/models/pack_st.py for FinancialIndicator, FinancialStressEvent classes
