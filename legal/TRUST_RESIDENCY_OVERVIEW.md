# TRUST & RESIDENCY OVERVIEW

**ADVISORY ONLY. NOT LEGAL ADVICE.**

This document models trust and residency concepts for strategic planning.

Execution requires licensed professionals (tax attorney, trust attorney, CPA).

## Current State

**Operator Residency:** (Where is operator currently based?)  
**Business Operations:** (Where does business operate?)  
**Capital Location:** (Where are assets held?)  
**Legal Entity Type:** (Corp, LLC, Sole Prop, Other?)  

## Trust Concepts

### What Trust Structure Accomplishes

- Separates business assets from personal liability
- Enables estate planning and succession
- Can provide tax efficiency (variable by structure)
- Allows creditor protection in some circumstances
- Enables operational continuity if operator changes

### When Trust Makes Sense

Trust structures become relevant when:

- Business reaches scale (typically $X+ in annual revenue)
- Operator wants succession planning
- Liability exposure becomes significant
- Multi-generational wealth transfer is goal
- Tax situation becomes complex

### When Trust Does NOT Make Sense Yet

- Business is pre-revenue or early stage
- Simple sole proprietorship works
- Complexity cost exceeds benefit
- Operator wants minimal overhead

## Residency Considerations

### Residency Impacts

- Tax liability (income, capital gains, estate)
- Operational location (where engines run)
- Legal jurisdiction (which courts apply)
- Reporting requirements (state, federal, international)

### Current Residency Situation

(Operator's current residency status and implications)

### Possible Future Residency Scenarios

**Scenario A: Remain current residency**
- Pro: Minimal disruption, known legal system
- Con: Tax efficiency may not be optimal
- Timeline: N/A (immediate)
- Implementation cost: Low

**Scenario B: Relocate within country**
- Pro: Potential tax optimization
- Con: Relocation costs, new legal framework
- Timeline: 3-6 months implementation
- Implementation cost: Medium

**Scenario C: International residency**
- Pro: Significant tax and operational flexibility
- Con: Complex, expensive, highly jurisdiction-specific
- Timeline: 6-12 months implementation
- Implementation cost: High

**Scenario D: Hybrid/Digital nomad**
- Pro: Operational flexibility
- Con: Tax reporting complexity
- Timeline: 3-6 months implementation
- Implementation cost: Medium

## Tax Implications

**This section is INFORMATIONAL ONLY. Not tax advice.**

General factors (actual numbers require CPA):

- Business structure affects tax rate
- Residency affects tax jurisdiction
- Capital gains treatment varies by structure
- Extraction strategy affects annual tax bill
- Timing of decisions affects multi-year taxes

## When to Act

### RED FLAGS (Get professional advice soon):

- [ ] Business revenue exceeds $X (your threshold)
- [ ] Operator considering residency change
- [ ] Business wants to scale across jurisdictions
- [ ] Significant capital accumulating
- [ ] Operator thinking about succession

### GREEN FLAGS (Can wait):

- [ ] Business is early stage
- [ ] Single jurisdiction operation
- [ ] Simple extraction model
- [ ] Operator not considering major changes
- [ ] Current structure working fine

## When NOT to Act

### Do NOT pursue trust/residency changes if:

- [ ] Business structure is working well
- [ ] Complexity cost exceeds tax benefit (by CPA estimate)
- [ ] Operator doesn't have clear goal
- [ ] Just copying what others do
- [ ] Can be deferred 12+ months without downside

## Professional Resources Needed

When you decide to move forward:

1. **Tax Attorney** — Trust and residency structure
2. **CPA** — Tax implications and reporting
3. **Business Attorney** — Entity formation and governance
4. **Financial Advisor** (optional) — Wealth strategy

Budget: $X-$Y for initial setup (varies by complexity)

## Strategic Roadmap

### Year 1 (Current)
- Monitor business growth
- Track residency/tax situation
- No major changes planned
- Gather information on options

### Year 2-3
- If business scales significantly, revisit trust options
- If residency change appealing, research jurisdictions
- Consult professionals on optimization
- Evaluate cost/benefit of changes

### Year 4+
- Execute trust/residency strategy if decision is made
- Implement changes with professional guidance
- Document all decisions for tax/legal purposes
- Review periodically (annual or every 3 years)

## Key Principle

**Do not pursue trust or residency changes for complexity's sake.**

Act when:
- Clear business reason exists
- Professional analysis shows benefit > cost
- Operator is willing to learn and manage the complexity
- Timeline aligns with business growth

Wait when:
- Business is stable and simple
- No immediate need
- Uncertainty exists about goals
- Better use of energy elsewhere
