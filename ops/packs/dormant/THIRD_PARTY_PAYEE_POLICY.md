# Third-Party Payee Safety Ladder (Dormant)

Default: Advisory-only.

## Level 1 (Advisory)

- System may prepare instructions and recommendations only.
- No execution without explicit human confirmation.
- All payments documented and audited.

## Level 2 (Assisted Execution)

- Pre-approved payees only
- Caps lower than internal transfers
- Requires final human confirmation
- No new payees created automatically
- Every transaction logged

## Never

- Automatic wires
- Irreversible transfers without explicit human gate
- Credential storage in code
- Unlogged transactions

## Activation

This policy activates when:
1. Phase 4 testing begins
2. Business requires external payee support
3. Governor explicitly enables Level 2

Until then: DORMANT (advisory templates only)
