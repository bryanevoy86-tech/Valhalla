# Long-Horizon Alignment Check (Dormant)

Purpose: prevent short-term actions from damaging legacy goals.

## Questions Heimdall asks
- Does this improve durability?
- Does this increase risk materially?
- Does this distract from the main engine?
- Does this create ongoing overhead?
- Is it reversible?
- Does it threaten the 90/10 rule?
- Does it reduce optionality later?

## Output
- Green / Yellow / Red
- Why
- Safer alternative path (if Yellow/Red)
- "Do nothing" if already aligned
