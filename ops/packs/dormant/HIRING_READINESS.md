# Hiring Readiness Pack (Dormant)

Goal: Know WHEN and WHO to hire without bloating early operations.

## Hiring Triggers (examples)
- Lead volume exceeds operator capacity
- Follow-ups are slipping
- Deals stall due to admin load
- Buyer management becomes a bottleneck

## First hires (typical order)
1) Transaction coordinator / admin VA
2) Dispo VA (buyers + follow-up)
3) Bookkeeping support (monthly)
4) Acquisition support (later)

## Output Heimdall should produce
- Current bottleneck
- Suggested role + scope
- KPIs (simple)
- "Hire vs wait" recommendation
