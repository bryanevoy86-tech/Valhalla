# Financial Snapshot (Conservative)

## Operational Economics

- Early-stage revenue expectations
- Reinvestment-first posture
- No dependency on debt
- No lifestyle pressure on business

## Capital Structure

- Operating funds: For day-to-day execution
- Reinvestment capital: Majority of profits

## Key Metrics

The business prioritizes:
- Capital accumulation
- Stability over growth
- Long-term sustainability
- Proof of repeatable processes

## Conservative Baseline

Phase 2 projections (read-only simulation):
- **Daily profit:** ~$1,800 (expected case)
- **Monthly profit:** ~$54,000 (expected case)
- **Personal extraction:** ~$5,400/month
- **Reinvestment:** ~$48,600/month

These are conservative, single-lead simulations pending real operational data.
