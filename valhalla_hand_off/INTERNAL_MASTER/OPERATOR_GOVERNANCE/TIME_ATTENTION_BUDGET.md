# Time & Attention Budget (INTERNAL)

## Goal
Prevent the operator from becoming the bottleneck.

## Rules
- Sandbox monitoring: max 10 minutes/check, max 3 checks/day
- Build work: 1–3 focused blocks/day
- No "tinkering" during proof runs
- Decisions made from digests + reports, not vibes

## Escalation
If I'm doing the same manual step 3 times:
- either automate it
- or template it
- or remove it
