# Playbook: Lead Quality Decay

## Early signals
- Scores pinned low
- High duplicate rate
- Increased quarantine rate
- Low conversion indicators

## Immediate actions
- Increase source credibility weighting (priority only)
- Reduce intake volume caps temporarily
- Audit top 20% sources for quality
- Add validation rules for known junk patterns (sandbox first)

## Do NOT do
- Do not widen funnels blindly
- Do not change core scoring logic mid-proof run

## Recovery success criteria
- Score distribution returns to healthy range
- Quarantine stabilizes
- Duplicates remain near zero
