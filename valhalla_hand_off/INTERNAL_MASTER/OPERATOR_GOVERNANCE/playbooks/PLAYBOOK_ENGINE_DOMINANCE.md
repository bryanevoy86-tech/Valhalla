# Playbook: Engine Dominance

## Early signals
- One engine consumes all simulated resources
- Other engines produce little signal
- Integrated reports show starvation

## Immediate actions
- Enforce min budget allocations
- Throttle dominant engine temporarily
- Evaluate ROI vs noise for starved engines
- Kill or archive engines that consistently underperform

## Do NOT do
- Do not run 5 new engines at once to "fix it"
- Do not remove caps

## Recovery success criteria
- Balanced output signals
- Clear priority allocation justified by evidence
