# Playbook: Capital Bottleneck

## Early signals
- Good deals throttled for lack of capital
- Too many commitments queued
- ROI opportunities missed due to cash timing

## Immediate actions (safe)
- Prioritize highest confidence exits
- Reduce low-signal experiments
- Extend proof windows to validate capital velocity improvements
- Prepare banking/accounting package for scaling conversations

## Do NOT do
- Do not take on leverage impulsively
- Do not increase extraction beyond policy

## Recovery success criteria
- Capital cycling stabilizes
- Deal throughput becomes predictable
