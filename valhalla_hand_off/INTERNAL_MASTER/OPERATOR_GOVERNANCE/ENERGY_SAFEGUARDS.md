# Energy Safeguards (INTERNAL)

## Non-negotiable
No major decisions while exhausted, angry, or euphoric.

## Rules
- Any irreversible decision: sleep on it (24h) unless safety issue
- If I'm overstimulated: I only observe, I do not change
- Daily hard stop: protect sleep and recovery
- Weekly: at least one full off-day from systems work

## Why
The system must survive me being human.
