# Source Credibility (Sandbox-Only)

## Purpose
Improve starting stance by prioritizing high-signal sources without rejecting opportunity.

## Rule
Credibility modifies priority, not acceptance.

## How to use
- Tag each lead with a "source"
- Map to credibility score using source_credibility_v1.json
- Use it as a weight in sorting/queueing (later)
- Do not block ingestion based on source
