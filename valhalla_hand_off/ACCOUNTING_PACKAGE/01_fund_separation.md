# Fund Separation

Accounts are logically separated into:

## Operating Funds
- Day-to-day transaction costs
- Lead acquisition expenses
- Deal analysis and routing costs
- System maintenance and operations

## Reinvestment Capital
- Majority of profits flow here
- Used for scaling operations
- Building reserves
- Expanding market reach

## Personal Fun Funds (10%)
- Limited, disciplined extraction
- Sustainable lifestyle support
- Non-speculative personal use
- Clearly tracked and separate

---

## Enforcement

This separation is enforced consistently:
- Clear account structure
- Monthly reconciliation
- Audit trails
- Stakeholder reporting
