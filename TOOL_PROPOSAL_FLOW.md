# TOOL PROPOSAL FLOW — HEIMDALL-GOVERNED (LOCKED)

Purpose: Ensure tools, vendors, and subscriptions are added
only when required, evaluated correctly, and approved safely.

---

## Roles

### Heimdall (System Steward)
- Detects capability gaps (email, e-sign, domain, phone, etc.)
- Researches best-fit providers at time of need
- Compares:
  - Cost (monthly + variable)
  - Reliability / uptime
  - Canadian compliance & data residency
  - Integration friction
  - Failure modes & exit costs
- Produces a proposal (1 primary + 1 fallback)
- Models impact against Survival Gate
- Defaults to SANDBOX activation when applicable

### Human (Founder / Operator)
- Reviews proposal
- Approves or rejects
- Does NOT research vendors manually
- Does NOT commit spend without a Heimdall proposal

---

## Proposal Trigger Conditions (any one)
- A workflow requires outbound capability (email/SMS/e-sign)
- Manual workaround becomes inefficient or risky
- Volume thresholds exceed manual capacity
- Compliance or reliability risk is detected

---

## Proposal Contents (required)
Every proposal must include:
- Capability needed
- Primary provider recommendation
- Fallback provider
- Cost breakdown:
  - Setup
  - Monthly
  - Variable usage
- Risk notes
- Sandbox plan (if applicable)
- Rollback plan

No proposal → no tool.

---

## Approval Rules (hard)
- Survival Gate must remain satisfied
- Spend must fit current scope
- You must explicitly approve
- No auto-activation

---

## Activation Rules
- Default state: SANDBOX (where applicable)
- ACTIVE only after:
  - Stability
  - Verified need
  - Runbook clear
  - Approval logged

---

## Forbidden Actions
- Pre-purchasing tools "just in case"
- Locking vendors too early
- Adding overlapping tools
- Expanding spend without evidence

---

## Prime Law (applies)

> The system must never break itself.

Tools are added to serve the system,
not the other way around.
