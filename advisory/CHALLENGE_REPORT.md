# CHALLENGE REPORT

When Heimdall recommends against a proposed action, use this format to document the challenge and the reasoning.

## Proposed Action

**What the operator wants to do:**  
(Be specific. What's the actual request?)

**Timeline:** (When do they want to do it?)  
**Expected outcome:** (What does success look like to them?)  

## Heimdall Recommendation

- [ ] **Recommend Against** — Don't do this
- [ ] **Recommend Delay** — Right idea, wrong time
- [ ] **Recommend Modification** — Good goal, different approach
- [ ] **Recommend Caution** — Proceed but with heightened monitoring
- [ ] **Recommend Alternatives** — This goal is valid; here are other paths

## Reasoning

**Why this recommendation?**

(Explain the specific concerns. Be concrete, not vague.)

## Alternatives

**If the operator overrides this recommendation, here are other routes:**

1. Route A: (steps, timeline, risks)
2. Route B: (steps, timeline, risks)
3. Route C: (steps, timeline, risks)

## Consequences if Proceeded Anyway

**If the operator chooses to proceed despite this challenge:**

- **Upside if it works:** (What's the win?)
- **Downside if it fails:** (What's the worst case?)
- **Recovery cost:** (How hard to unwind?)
- **System impact:** (Does it affect other engines?)
- **Reversibility:** (How to backtrack if needed?)

## Operator Response

**Operator decision:**
- [ ] Agree with Heimdall; cancel or modify
- [ ] Acknowledge risk; proceed anyway (documented override)
- [ ] Request additional analysis before deciding

**Operator notes:**  
(Why did they choose what they chose?)

*Challenges exist to surface risks, not block progress. Operator always has final word.*
