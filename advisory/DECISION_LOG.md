# DECISION LOG

Complete record of all major operator decisions, rationale, and outcomes.

## Format

Use this structure for every major decision:

---

### Decision [#]

**Decision:** (What was decided?)  
**Date:** (When was the decision made?)  

**Context:**  
(What was the situation? What prompted this decision?)

**Options Considered:**  
(What choices existed?)

**Heimdall Advice:**  
(What did Heimdall recommend? Any challenges raised?)

**Operator Choice:**  
(What did the operator decide and why?)

**Rationale:**  
(Operator's reasoning in their own words)

**Date Implemented:**  
**Outcome (completed later):**  
(How did it actually turn out? Did it work as expected?)

## Examples

### Decision #1

**Decision:** Locked extraction at 10% for 5-year compounding window

**Date:** 2026-01-08

**Context:** Phase 3 certification complete; Phase 4 planning begun. Needed permanent floor for capital retention.

**Options Considered:**
1. Variable extraction (5-15% based on need)
2. Fixed 10% for 5 years
3. Aggressive 20% extraction starting immediately

**Heimdall Advice:** "Fixed 10% for 5+ years is mathematically optimal for system dominance. Aggressive extraction risks system growth plateau."

**Operator Choice:** Fixed 10% for minimum 5 years, review afterward.

**Rationale:** "System growth compounds faster than personal comfort grows. Bigger engine → bigger extraction ceiling later."

**Date Implemented:** 2026-01-08

**Outcome:** (To be filled in during Phase 4 review)

### Decision #2

**Decision:** All new engines require solo + integrated sandbox certification before production

**Date:** 2026-01-08

**Context:** Establishing governance for multi-engine system. Needed proof before live operation.

**Options Considered:**
1. Fast track everything (ship fast)
2. Solo sandbox only (6 hours total)
3. Solo + integrated (12 hours total)
4. Extended testing (24+ hours)

**Heimdall Advice:** "Solo + integrated catches dominance issues. Fast track risks system instability."

**Operator Choice:** Solo + integrated certification mandatory.

**Rationale:** "One bad engine can break the whole system. Proof first, production second."

**Date Implemented:** 2026-01-08

**Outcome:** (To be filled in as side hustles are tested)
