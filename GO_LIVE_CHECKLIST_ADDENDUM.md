# GO-LIVE CHECKLIST — ADDENDUM (TOOL & SPEND SEQUENCING)

This addendum clarifies how tools, vendors, and subscriptions
enter the system during launch and scale.

---

## Core Infrastructure (Already Active)
These are foundational and intentionally locked early:
- WeWeb (frontend)
- Render (hosting)
- ChatGPT (system cognition)

These are not considered "optional tools."

---

## Deferred Tools (Intentional)
The following are NOT required for initial go-live:
- Email provider
- SMS / voice provider
- Domain registrar
- E-signature provider
- Accounting / payroll tools
- Marketing platforms

These are added only via Heimdall proposal.

---

## Correct Launch State
- System may go live in SANDBOX without these tools
- Manual execution outside the system is allowed during SANDBOX
- System remains compliant and demonstrable to EI

---

## Spend Discipline Rule
No monthly spend is added unless:
- Capability is required
- Heimdall proposes
- Survival Gate remains intact
- Human approval is recorded

---

## EI Alignment Note
This sequencing demonstrates:
- Fiscal responsibility
- Risk management
- Governance
- Intentional scaling

This is a strength, not a gap.
