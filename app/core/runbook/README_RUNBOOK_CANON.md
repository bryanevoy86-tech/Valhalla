# Runbook Canon (Locked)

- Runbook is authoritative for go-live.
- Runbook reports BLOCKERS, not opinions.
- No endpoint may bypass runbook or engine guards.
- SANDBOX allows real data, never real-world effects.
- ACTIVE still requires runbook to be clear.

If runbook says BLOCKED:
The system is blocked.
No override.
