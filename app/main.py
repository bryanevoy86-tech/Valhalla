"""Higher-level app entrypoints (helpers and wiring) for Valhalla application.

This file is a lightweight stub that re-exports or wraps functionality from
`app.ai` and any app-level wiring. Keep `services/api/main.py` as the HTTP
entrypoint â€” this `app.main` is intentionally minimal so you can import it
from other modules without bringing FastAPI into the import graph.
